#

------------------------------------------------------
## Features

- Completely re-wires the game; new objectives, ranks, and lore
- Customized ranking system
- Lootbox heaven stocked with weapons, gear, and money
- Always be questioning friend or foe with Proximity Chat
- Perpetual night makes everything more immersive!

After a court mage, Stixor the Mad, was made to be a fool in front of the Exodus Court and the city, a dark spell was cast and a plague hit the realm of Exodus. The King, unable to deal with the onslaught solely with his forces, has demanded that his more recent mage, __Fumblforps__, deploy a spell that will bring all able-bodied Adventurer's to answer the call and save Exodus from it's own demons.

------------------------------------------------------
## Rules

Unfortunately, there are some rules as shitlords do exist. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the rules and guidelines of Exodus:

- __NO RACIAL SLANG, NEGATIVE WORDS__... I cant believe I have to write this
- __NO POLITICS.__ Again... why?
- __NO GRIEFING.__ We get it, you're unloved... GTFO if you can't get over it and love yourself.
- __NO PVP IN COURTYARD. PERIOD.__ 3 hits on someone in the courtyard is an IMMEDIATE PERMA-BAN
- __NO EXPLIOTING__. WHEN you are caught, PERMA-BAN.
- __NO LOOTBOX GOBLINS__. If you are caught taking EVERYTHING out of a lootbox, 3 DAY TEMP-BAN... don;t ruin it for everyone else
- __NO BEGGING__. Other travllers are not here to give you stuff and hold your hand. Temp-bans will be given to whiney & begging travellers.
- __NO SPAWN CAMPING__. Yes, the TP is random, but if you are caught waiting around for players in places where you find spawns occuring, PERMA-BAN
- __PvP IS ALLOWED, but__ it has to be in the world, and it has to be warranted. No one would immediately start killing people during a Zombie apocalypse... don't be a douche.
- There is __NO BUILDING PERMITTED__! This just means the plugin refuses it :) the ONLY things that can be placed are the _EverLanterns_ as they provide a source of light amongst the darkness for travellers.
- The is NO __BLOCK BREAKING PERMITTED__! This ALSO means the plugin refuses it :) the ONLY blocks you can break are the _EverLanterns_ as they are placed to provide a source of light and can be "picked up" by the traveller when done.

As long as we all keep a fun, enjoyable experience for everyone then **Exodus:Blackout** will be around for awhile. I'll be dipped in liqiud metal if this turns into some COD/Fartnite bullcrap XD

------------------------------------------------------
## Starting

When you first join **Exodus:Blackout**, you will be dropped in the Courtyard (Spawn) of the world. You will be given a *Daily Bouns* as well as 2 books; the first tells the lore of the realm and story, and the second is a written guide to some of the aspects within Exodus. You will also receive **$350** in coins to assist in the starting of your endeavours.

Be sure to follow the Glowstone path through the castle to find the hotpoints that will equip you with the right gear & knowledge. the 3 main locations every traveller SHOULD visit are:

1. Arachnix (Merchant)
2. Quartermaster Munds (Armor & Weapons)
3. Wall of Commands: _This is a HUGE asset as it will answer most all the questions you may have!_

Look the the __Wall of Commands__ if you forget any spells used in Exodus, or use the __Glowstone__ path so you don't get lost!

##### ___Perpetual Night___
Along with the fun, excitement filled time the Zombie plague offers, Stixor's spell cast a __Perpetual Night__ shadow over the realm. Just as you think its about to turn into a beautiful dawn morning, Stixor's spell reverts it all back to blissful, quiet, black night...

Just a heads up...

------------------------------------------------------
## Courtyard
The **Courtyard** is the Safe Zone in Exodus and is where you will be able to rest, refit, and redeploy to the battlefield. Here you will come across 2 merchants; Arachnix the Merchant and Quartermaster Munds.

------------------------------------------------------
## Bank
All travellers are given a spell upon arrival that allows them to access the funds they receive during their time in Exodus. The bank is summoned by using the `/exobank` OR '/exob' spell, with different attunements to focus the spell. Below are the spells and attunements for Exodus:

| Spell | Attunement | Addtl. Attunements | Description |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| /exobank | bal | None | Checks your current coin balance. This does not need any additional attunements as it ONLY checks the casters balance |
| /exobank | pay | [traveller] [amount] | Pays a specific traveller the given amount of coin, should the payer have enough for the gesture

___Any enchanted vouchers found in Lootboxes willbe IMMEDIATELY accredited to the users coin balance.___

------------------------------------------------------
## Quartermaster Munds _(Quartermaster/Blacksmith)_

  - Food - Jerky, chicken, tack... the cook is the finest in the realm and the food is ALMOST amazing...
#

#### WARNING
> __DO NOT__ click the items in your inventory while in a shop! You will purchase more of the item! __CLOSE THE SHOP__ before you try to move items around!!!
#

------------------------------------------------------
## Expdus Alchemist _(Potions)_
> _Right-Click her_

#

#### WARNING
> __DO NOT__ click the items in your inventory while in a shop! You will purchase more of the item! __CLOSE THE SHOP__ before you try to move items around!!!

------------------------------------------------------
## Fumblforps _(Mage)_
> _Right-Click him_

Fumblforps is the Apprentice standing inbetween Stixor the Mad and complete annihilation of Exodus... no pressure. Fumblforps will sell you enchantments for your weapons to give that fighting edge back to the Travellers.

#

#### WARNING
> __DO NOT__ click the items in your inventory while in a shop! You will purchase more of the item! __CLOSE THE SHOP__ before you try to move items around!!!
#

------------------------------------------------------
## Deployment

Once you are set with your items from Arachnix and Munds, you are ready to set weapon to undead flesh! This is simply done, from ANYWHERE in the world, by using the spell `/readyup`, or if you are an Adept magic user, `/rup` spell will also transport you.

You will be randomly, RANDOMLY (*Fumblforps is an apprentice*) teleported to outside the safe zone, and will be on your own! Be cautious traveller!

------------------------------------------------------
## Infection

Infection is a real thing! There is a probability that, should you get attacked by a monster, you will contract the plague! Your first move in the event that this happens; visit the Alchemist and get yourself the `Antoxin Potion` to reverse the effects!

While the Alchemist and Fumblforps are unable to CURE the plague, they have devised a way to reverse the early onsets of the disease. The potion will rid your body of the sickness, giving you life back and removing the possibility of a painful demise!

------------------------------------------------------
## Emit

Fumbleforps has developed a somewhat clever, albeit a shortcoming riddled way, to get back to the courtyard in a pinch. By using the crafted `/emit` spell, you will engage a teleportation spell that will get you back to safety... for a price.

> "A price for eveything, Mr. Goldenfold... a price, for eveything."
> -- Mr. Needful

This particular spell requires a sacrifice for it to work; _you will be trapped in place for __30 seconds__ and your vision will become obscurred._ Should you not be a Zombie dinner, you will be safely brought back to the courtyard to handle whatever issues or tasks you may need to handle.

## Ranking
Exodus:Blackout offers a __Ranking__ experience for all the travellers. Based on XP, you will be awarded specific ranks throughout your game play. These ranks will reward you with either _in-game_ items, or IRL items from the Discord! The ranks are as follows:

- __Traveller__: Everyone starts here
- __Neophyte__: Still fresh, but have been around and piled some corpses
- __Adventurer__: Not unfamiliar with the way Zombies think and move
- __Adept__: A force to be reckoned with when it comes to handling corpse loads
- __Paladin__: A hero in everyones eyes, and is on a first name basis with energies in the Aether
- __Knight__: "'Tis but a fleshwound", is a common mantra for these warriors
- __Templar__: Forged in the blood of themselves and the undead, these travellers are way beyond feeling anything but desensitization
- __Master__: They know more of Exodus than the King himself, some say. Look to these travellers in the darkness as they will quell any foe with no emotion.
- __Grandmaster__: More peaceful, scary-like composed actions, Grandmasters are one step away from true Ascension and are among the strongest in Exodus.
- __Ascended__: Familiar with the Aether, Death, and the space in between, the enlightened energies are more a combination of strength and knowledge rather than a physical form.

With each level comes more opportunity within Exodus! Slay the most, be the best, and ascend to the ranks of the elite.
#

------------------------------------------------------
## Lootboxes

During your exploring, you will come across the many villages that Exodus is home to. **EXPLORE THEM ALL!** The King has allowed the mage to fill these "lootboxes" with money and items that will assist you during your deployment. **DO NOT** take everything though; this is a joint effort to stop a madman, not a pissing contest!

**Exodus Coin Voucher's** will be found in lootboxes. These are ***enchanted scrolls*** and will award you with the scrawled amount when activated. To use:

1. Equip the Voucher in main hand
2. Right-Click with the voucher
3. Receive your award!
#

------------------------------------------------------
## Rucksack

Each traveller is given a **Rucksack** to keep your valuables safe. To use it, simply use the `/rucksack` OR `/rck` spells and your Rucksack will materialize and store things inside of it for safe keeping.

#### _NOTE_
> _When you die, your items __CANNOT__ travel with you through the Aether! Unless you summon your Rucksack and store items in it, you WILL lose all your gear! Be sure to store items in your Rucksack on a regular basis_
#

------------------------------------------------------
## Zombies and Villagers

Each Zombie/Zombie Villager kill will award the player with **15xp** and each time a player is faced with an infected player (someone who just has to PvP for some reason) then the player that wins will be awarded **25xp**. This XP will reflect on your HUD underneath your K/D Ratio and Title. **ZOMBIES WILL TURN VILLAGERS INTO ZOMBIES!!!**

------------------------------------------------------
## Proximity Chat

##### Text Chat
Currently, Exodus has a built in **Proximity Chat** feature that will allow you to ONLY communicate via the chat with individuals that are near you. Should a player be near you and you send out a message of, "Hello?" -- that player will only see it if they are within a specific range. Be sure to use this!

##### Voice Chat
Exodus had an update! We now have a Proximity based Voice Chat for the server, that is now REQUIRED to play within the Exodus world. Fear not, it isn't as hard to set up as it sounds. Follow the steps below to get everyhting linked and all plugged in:

> __NOTE__: Join the [Exodus Discord](https://discord.gg/RYwYEBQkwU) __FIRST__ and follow the necessary steps to receive the server address.

##### After Joining the Discord
1. Connect to the `exodus-igc-alpha` VC channel, and join the __Exodus:Blackout__ Minecraft server
2. In the `exodus-igc-link` channel, type `*link [minecraft username]` replacing the obvious with the obvious.
3. This will open a new DM; go to it and copy the `/link [CODE[` that is given to you
4. In Minecraft, copy the `/link [CODE[` and paste it into the command input
5. You will receive a message that saya something like, `"Your accounts are connected/linked"`
6. Disconnect from the `exodus-igc-alpha` channel AND the Minecraft server
7. Reconnect the VC and re-join the server!

There may be some delay or it may seem as if it doesnt work, but give it a little bit and it will do as its needed. We also have a nifty setup that will make the immersion of the VC more realistic. This can be found within the `suggested-setup` channel within our Discord.

------------------------------------------------------
## Death

>> "Inevitably, you will die... but that is a sacrifice, I am willing to make"
>> -- Lord Farquad

These things happen, but don't worry! It is not the end. Well, not completely... When you are consumed, your energy will be transferred to the __Aether__; there Fumblforpes can summon your energy back into a physical form in the __Courtyard__ where you can continue your adventures! However, there is a catch...

Fumblforps is an Apprentice, and the ability for... well, his abilities are lacking in some aspects. Upon your death, a __Death Chest__ will drop where you were last consumed. This will remain for a shirt while, and ___MAY___ have your gear in it... it is somewhat difficult for the items to ALWAYS meet there goal. Thats what the __Rucksack__ is for!

------------------------------------------------------
## Final Notes
This is still in its __BETA__ version! Should there be any questions, comments, issues, or reports that need to be made, please reach out to the Exodus:Blackout Discord to get it resolved.

`EXPECT SOME BUGS`

> The current version is 2.3.0
> Tested on Minecraft versions 1.18+

------------------------------------------------------
